# APT-A2-Qwirkle

This was a class based project designed by me and developed in a group of 4 for the subject Advanced Programming Techniques.

This is a program that runs in a UNIX terminal (has not been tested on other terminals yet). To run the program, download the 'qwirkle' file into a UNIX OS, open a terminal and run the program using the './qwirkle' command when in directory of the program in the terminal.


To Understand how the game rules work, please download the "assignment2v1.0.pdf" to understand how we implemented the game from the requirements gathering.
